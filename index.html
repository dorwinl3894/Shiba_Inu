                <h3>A small, agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain, the Shiba Inu was originally bred
                    for
                    hunting. It looks similar to and is often mistaken for other Japanese dog breeds like the Akita Inu
                    or
                    Hokkaido, but the Shiba Inu is a different breed with a distinct blood line, temperament and
                    smaller
                    size than other Japanese dog breeds</h3>

        <div class="name-section">
            <h3 id="name-info">Inu is the Japanese word for dog, but the origin of the prefix "Shiba" is less clear.
                The word shiba
                means
                "brushwood" in Japanese, and refers to a type of tree or shrub whose leaves turn red in the fall. This
                leads some to believe that the Shiba was named with this in mind, either because the dogs were used to
                hunt
                in wild shrubs, or because the most common color of the Shiba Inu is a red color similar to that of the
                shrubs. However, in an old Nagano dialect, the word shiba also had the meaning of "small", thus this
                might
                be a reference to the dog's diminutive stature. Therefore, the Shiba Inu is sometimes translated as
                "Little
                Brushwood Dog".</h3>

                sex.
